 2024 Mid-year population estimates
Media Release                                                                                                                                                          30 July 2024
                                                                     2024 Mid-year population estimates
South Africa’s mid-year population is estimated to have increased to 63,02 million in 2024, with the female population accounting for 51,0% (approximately 32,13 million) of the population, this is according to the report released by Statistics South Africa today.
Gauteng continues to record the largest share of the South African population, with approximately 15,83 million people (25,1%) living in this province. KwaZulu-Natal is the province with the second largest population, with an estimated 12,34 million people (19,6%) living in this province. With a population of approximately 1,36 million people (2,2%), Northern Cape remains the province with the smallest share of the South African population.
According to the report, 27,5% of the population is aged younger than 15 years (16,8 million) and approximately 9,7% (6,13 million) is 60 years or older. The provinces reflecting the highest percentage of children younger than 15 within its structure are Limpopo (33,2%) and EC (31,8%). The proportion of elderly persons aged 60 years and older in South Africa is increasing over time and as such policies and programmes to care for the needs of this growing population should be prioritised.
The report further shows that life expectancy at birth for 2024 is estimated at 63,6 years for males and 69,2 years for females.
The infant mortality rate for 2024 is estimated at 22,9 per 1 000 live births.
The estimated overall HIV prevalence rate is approximately 12,7% among the South African population. The total number of people living with HIV (PLWHIV) is estimated at approximately 8,0 million in 2024. For adults aged 15–49 years, an estimated 16,7% of the population is HIV positive.
For the period 2021–2026, Gauteng and Western Cape are estimated to experience the largest inflow of migrants of approximately, 1 401 895 and 491 296 respectively.
There is a reduction in international migration, which is indicative of the COVID-19 travel restrictions and subsequent impact on migratory patterns since March 2020. Migration is an important demographic process, as it shapes the age structure and distribution of the national and provincial population

                                                                     2024 Mid-year population estimates
South Africa’s mid-year population is estimated to have increased to 63,02 million in 2024, with the female population accounting for 51,0% (approximately 32,13 million) of the population, this is according to the report released by Statistics South Africa today.
Gauteng continues to record the largest share of the South African population, with approximately 15,83 million people (25,1%) living in this province. KwaZulu-Natal is the province with the second largest population, with an estimated 12,34 million people (19,6%) living in this province. With a population of approximately 1,36 million people (2,2%), Northern Cape remains the province with the smallest share of the South African population.
According to the report, 27,5% of the population is aged younger than 15 years (16,8 million) and approximately 9,7% (6,13 million) is 60 years or older. The provinces reflecting the highest percentage of children younger than 15 within its structure are Limpopo (33,2%) and EC (31,8%). The proportion of elderly persons aged 60 years and older in South Africa is increasing over time and as such policies and programmes to care for the needs of this growing population should be prioritised.
The report further shows that life expectancy at birth for 2024 is estimated at 63,6 years for males and 69,2 years for females.
The infant mortality rate for 2024 is estimated at 22,9 per 1 000 live births.
The estimated overall HIV prevalence rate is approximately 12,7% among the South African population. The total number of people living with HIV (PLWHIV) is estimated at approximately 8,0 million in 2024. For adults aged 15–49 years, an estimated 16,7% of the population is HIV positive.
For the period 2021–2026, Gauteng and Western Cape are estimated to experience the largest inflow of migrants of approximately, 1 401 895 and 491 296 respectively.
There is a reduction in international migration, which is indicative of the COVID-19 travel restrictions and subsequent impact on migratory patterns since March 2020. Migration is an important demographic process, as it shapes the age structure and distribution of the national and provincial population

Media Release                                                                                                                                                          30 July 2024
                                                                     2024 Mid-year population estimates
South Africa’s mid-year population is estimated to have increased to 63,02 million in 2024, with the female population accounting for 51,0% (approximately 32,13 million) of the population, this is according to the report released by Statistics South Africa today.
Gauteng continues to record the largest share of the South African population, with approximately 15,83 million people (25,1%) living in this province. KwaZulu-Natal is the province with the second largest population, with an estimated 12,34 million people (19,6%) living in this province. With a population of approximately 1,36 million people (2,2%), Northern Cape remains the province with the smallest share of the South African population.
According to the report, 27,5% of the population is aged younger than 15 years (16,8 million) and approximately 9,7% (6,13 million) is 60 years or older. The provinces reflecting the highest percentage of children younger than 15 within its structure are Limpopo (33,2%) and EC (31,8%). The proportion of elderly persons aged 60 years and older in South Africa is increasing over time and as such policies and programmes to care for the needs of this growing population should be prioritised.
The report further shows that life expectancy at birth for 2024 is estimated at 63,6 years for males and 69,2 years for females.
The infant mortality rate for 2024 is estimated at 22,9 per 1 000 live births.
The estimated overall HIV prevalence rate is approximately 12,7% among the South African population. The total number of people living with HIV (PLWHIV) is estimated at approximately 8,0 million in 2024. For adults aged 15–49 years, an estimated 16,7% of the population is HIV positive.
For the period 2021–2026, Gauteng and Western Cape are estimated to experience the largest inflow of migrants of approximately, 1 401 895 and 491 296 respectively.
There is a reduction in international migration, which is indicative of the COVID-19 travel restrictions and subsequent impact on migratory patterns since March 2020. Migration is an important demographic process, as it shapes the age structure and distribution of the national and provincial population

Population density in South Africa (darker color = higher density)
According to the 2022 census, the population of South Africa is about 62 million people of diverse origins, cultures, languages, and religions. With a majority being Black Africans.[3] The South African National Census of 2022 was the most recent census held; the next will be in 2032.[4]
In 2011, Statistics South Africa counted 2.1 million foreigners in total.[5] Reports[specify] suggest that is an underestimation. The real figure may be as high as five million,[6] including some three million Zimbabweans.[7]


History[edit]
Historical population of South AfricaThe earliest creatures that can be identified as human ancestors in South Africa are  australopithecines. The first evidence of this was a child's skull found in the Taung quarry site. This was in the modern day North-West province. More fossils australopithecines were found in limestone caves Sterkfontein, Swartkrans, and Kromdaai. [8]Further information: History of South Africa

1904–85 national census numbers[edit]
Bantustan demographics were removed from South African census data during Apartheid and for this reason official figures on the national population of the country during that period will be inaccurate.[12]

Statistics South Africa asks people to describe themselves in the census in terms of five racial population groups.[29] The 2011 census figures for these groups were African at 80.2%, White at 8.4%, Coloured at 8.8%, Indian/Asian at 2.5%, and Other/Unspecified at 0.5%.[30]
The white percentage of the population has sharply declined. The first census in South Africa in 1911 showed that whites made up 22% of the population. This declined to 16% in 1980,[31] 8.9% in 2011 and 7.65% in 2022.[32]: 21  Coloured South Africans replaced Whites as the largest minority group around 2010.

Languages[edit]
Main article: Languages of South Africa
South Africa has twelve official languages:[33] isiZulu[30] 24.4%, isiXhosa[30] 16.3%, Afrikaans[30] 10.6%, English[30] 8.7%, Sepedi[30] 10.0%, Setswana[30] 8.3%, Sesotho[30] 7.8%, Xitsonga[30] 4.7%, siSwati[30] 2.8%, Tshivenda[30] 2.5%, isiNdebele[30] 1.7% and South African Sign Language.[34]
In this regard, it is third only to Bolivia and India in number. While all the languages are formally equal, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2022 census, the three most spoken languages in the household are Zulu (24.4%), Xhosa (16.3%), and Afrikaans (10.6%).[3]
Between 1996 and 2022, the proportion of Afrikaans speakers declined from 14.5% to 10.6% and English held steady at 8.7%, whle isiZulu grew from 22.8% to 24.4%, and Xhosa declined from 17.9% to 16.3%[35]
The country also recognises several unofficial languages, including Sekholokoe, Fanagalo, Khwe, Lobedu, Nama, Northern Ndebele, Phuthi and San.[36] These unofficial languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.
Many of the ""unofficial languages"" of the San and Khoikhoi people contain regional dialects stretching northwards into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their hunter-gatherer societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming extinct.
Many white South Africans also speak other European languages, such as Portuguese (also spoken by black Angolans and Mozambicans), German, Serbian and Greek, while some Indians and other Asians in South Africa speak South Asian languages, such as Bhojpuri, Tamil, Hindi, Gujarati, Urdu and Telugu. Although many South Africans are of Huguenot (French) origin, South African French is spoken by fewer than 10,000 individuals country-wide. Congolese French is also spoken in South Africa by migrants.
The primary sign language of deaf South Africans is South African Sign Language. Other sign languages among indigenous peoples are also used.

According to the 2022 national census, Christians accounted for 85.3% of the population.[3] This includes[when?] Protestant (36.6%), Zionist Christian (11.1%), Pentecostal/Charismatic (8.2%), Roman Catholic (7.1%), Methodist (6.8%), Dutch Reformed (6.7%), Anglican (3.8%); members of other Christian churches accounted for another 36% of the population. Muslims accounted for 1.5% of the population, Other 2.3%, and 1.4% were Unspecified and None 15.1%.[citation needed]
Muslims are largely found among the Coloured and Indian ethnic groups. They have been joined by black or white South African converts as well as immigrants from other parts of Africa.[39] South African Muslims claim that their faith is the fastest-growing religion of conversion in the country, with the number of black Muslims growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004.[39][40]
The Hindu population has its roots in the British colonial period, but later waves of immigration from India have also contributed to it. Most Hindus are of South Asian origin, but there are many who come from mixed racial stock. Some are converts due to the efforts of ISKCON.
Other minority religions in South Africa are Sikhism, Jainism, Baháʼí Faith and Judaism.[41]

By ethnicity[edit]
86.0% of black residents are Christian, 3.0% have no religion, 0.3% are Muslim, 0.0% are Jewish, 0.0% are Hindu, 9.5% Traditional African and 1.2% have other or undetermined beliefs (2022 Census).
90.1% of white residents are Christian, 4.9% have no religion, 0.3% are Muslim, 0.7% are Jewish, and 0.1% are Hindu. 3.9% have other or undetermined beliefs (2022 Census).

Immigration[edit]

Main article: Immigration to South Africa
South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the World Refugee Survey 2008, published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007.[43] Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from Zimbabwe (48,400), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (24,800), and Somalia (12,900).[43] These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth.[43] Many refugees have now also started to work and live in rural areas in provinces such as Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal.
Statistics SA assumes in some of their calculations that there are fewer than 2 million immigrants in South Africa.[44] Other institutions, like the police and Médecins Sans Frontières place estimate the figure at 4 million.[45][46][47][48]

Others pointed out that the repeal of the Population Registration Act in 1991 removed any legal basis for specifying 'race'. The Identification Act of 1997 makes no mention of race. On the other hand, the Employment Equity Act speaks of 'designated groups' being 'black people, women and people with disabilities'. The Act defines 'black' as referring to 'Africans, coloureds and Indians'. Apartheid and the racial identification which underpinned it explicitly linked race with differential access to resources and power. If the post-apartheid order was committed to remedying this, race would have to be included in surveys and censuses, so that progress in eradicating the consequences of apartheid could be measured and monitored. This was the reasoning that led to a 'self-identifying' question about 'race' or 'population group' in both the 1996 and 2001 population censuses, and in Statistics SA's household survey programme.

Population density in South Africa (darker color = higher density)
According to the 2022 census, the population of South Africa is about 62 million people of diverse origins, cultures, languages, and religions. With a majority being Black Africans.[3] The South African National Census of 2022 was the most recent census held; the next will be in 2032.[4]
In 2011, Statistics South Africa counted 2.1 million foreigners in total.[5] Reports[specify] suggest that is an underestimation. The real figure may be as high as five million,[6] including some three million Zimbabweans.[7]


History[edit]
Historical population of South AfricaThe earliest creatures that can be identified as human ancestors in South Africa are  australopithecines. The first evidence of this was a child's skull found in the Taung quarry site. This was in the modern day North-West province. More fossils australopithecines were found in limestone caves Sterkfontein, Swartkrans, and Kromdaai. [8]Further information: History of South Africa

1904–85 national census numbers[edit]
Bantustan demographics were removed from South African census data during Apartheid and for this reason official figures on the national population of the country during that period will be inaccurate.[12]

Statistics South Africa asks people to describe themselves in the census in terms of five racial population groups.[29] The 2011 census figures for these groups were African at 80.2%, White at 8.4%, Coloured at 8.8%, Indian/Asian at 2.5%, and Other/Unspecified at 0.5%.[30]
The white percentage of the population has sharply declined. The first census in South Africa in 1911 showed that whites made up 22% of the population. This declined to 16% in 1980,[31] 8.9% in 2011 and 7.65% in 2022.[32]: 21  Coloured South Africans replaced Whites as the largest minority group around 2010.

Languages[edit]
Main article: Languages of South Africa
South Africa has twelve official languages:[33] isiZulu[30] 24.4%, isiXhosa[30] 16.3%, Afrikaans[30] 10.6%, English[30] 8.7%, Sepedi[30] 10.0%, Setswana[30] 8.3%, Sesotho[30] 7.8%, Xitsonga[30] 4.7%, siSwati[30] 2.8%, Tshivenda[30] 2.5%, isiNdebele[30] 1.7% and South African Sign Language.[34]
In this regard, it is third only to Bolivia and India in number. While all the languages are formally equal, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2022 census, the three most spoken languages in the household are Zulu (24.4%), Xhosa (16.3%), and Afrikaans (10.6%).[3]
Between 1996 and 2022, the proportion of Afrikaans speakers declined from 14.5% to 10.6% and English held steady at 8.7%, whle isiZulu grew from 22.8% to 24.4%, and Xhosa declined from 17.9% to 16.3%[35]
The country also recognises several unofficial languages, including Sekholokoe, Fanagalo, Khwe, Lobedu, Nama, Northern Ndebele, Phuthi and San.[36] These unofficial languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.
Many of the ""unofficial languages"" of the San and Khoikhoi people contain regional dialects stretching northwards into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their hunter-gatherer societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming extinct.
Many white South Africans also speak other European languages, such as Portuguese (also spoken by black Angolans and Mozambicans), German, Serbian and Greek, while some Indians and other Asians in South Africa speak South Asian languages, such as Bhojpuri, Tamil, Hindi, Gujarati, Urdu and Telugu. Although many South Africans are of Huguenot (French) origin, South African French is spoken by fewer than 10,000 individuals country-wide. Congolese French is also spoken in South Africa by migrants.
The primary sign language of deaf South Africans is South African Sign Language. Other sign languages among indigenous peoples are also used.

Judaism (0.1%)
Atheism (0.1%)
Agnosticism (0.1%)

According to the 2022 national census, Christians accounted for 85.3% of the population.[3] This includes[when?] Protestant (36.6%), Zionist Christian (11.1%), Pentecostal/Charismatic (8.2%), Roman Catholic (7.1%), Methodist (6.8%), Dutch Reformed (6.7%), Anglican (3.8%); members of other Christian churches accounted for another 36% of the population. Muslims accounted for 1.5% of the population, Other 2.3%, and 1.4% were Unspecified and None 15.1%.[citation needed]
Muslims are largely found among the Coloured and Indian ethnic groups. They have been joined by black or white South African converts as well as immigrants from other parts of Africa.[39] South African Muslims claim that their faith is the fastest-growing religion of conversion in the country, with the number of black Muslims growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004.[39][40]
The Hindu population has its roots in the British colonial period, but later waves of immigration from India have also contributed to it. Most Hindus are of South Asian origin, but there are many who come from mixed racial stock. Some are converts due to the efforts of ISKCON.
Other minority religions in South Africa are Sikhism, Jainism, Baháʼí Faith and Judaism.[41]

By ethnicity[edit]
86.0% of black residents are Christian, 3.0% have no religion, 0.3% are Muslim, 0.0% are Jewish, 0.0% are Hindu, 9.5% Traditional African and 1.2% have other or undetermined beliefs (2022 Census).
90.1% of white residents are Christian, 4.9% have no religion, 0.3% are Muslim, 0.7% are Jewish, and 0.1% are Hindu. 3.9% have other or undetermined beliefs (2022 Census).

Immigration[edit]

Main article: Immigration to South Africa
South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the World Refugee Survey 2008, published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007.[43] Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from Zimbabwe (48,400), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (24,800), and Somalia (12,900).[43] These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth.[43] Many refugees have now also started to work and live in rural areas in provinces such as Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal.
Statistics SA assumes in some of their calculations that there are fewer than 2 million immigrants in South Africa.[44] Other institutions, like the police and Médecins Sans Frontières place estimate the figure at 4 million.[45][46][47][48]

Others pointed out that the repeal of the Population Registration Act in 1991 removed any legal basis for specifying 'race'. The Identification Act of 1997 makes no mention of race. On the other hand, the Employment Equity Act speaks of 'designated groups' being 'black people, women and people with disabilities'. The Act defines 'black' as referring to 'Africans, coloureds and Indians'. Apartheid and the racial identification which underpinned it explicitly linked race with differential access to resources and power. If the post-apartheid order was committed to remedying this, race would have to be included in surveys and censuses, so that progress in eradicating the consequences of apartheid could be measured and monitored. This was the reasoning that led to a 'self-identifying' question about 'race' or 'population group' in both the 1996 and 2001 population censuses, and in Statistics SA's household survey programme.

Population density in South Africa (darker color = higher density)
According to the 2022 census, the population of South Africa is about 62 million people of diverse origins, cultures, languages, and religions. With a majority being Black Africans.[3] The South African National Census of 2022 was the most recent census held; the next will be in 2032.[4]
In 2011, Statistics South Africa counted 2.1 million foreigners in total.[5] Reports[specify] suggest that is an underestimation. The real figure may be as high as five million,[6] including some three million Zimbabweans.[7]


History[edit]
Historical population of South AfricaThe earliest creatures that can be identified as human ancestors in South Africa are  australopithecines. The first evidence of this was a child's skull found in the Taung quarry site. This was in the modern day North-West province. More fossils australopithecines were found in limestone caves Sterkfontein, Swartkrans, and Kromdaai. [8]Further information: History of South Africa

1904–85 national census numbers[edit]
Bantustan demographics were removed from South African census data during Apartheid and for this reason official figures on the national population of the country during that period will be inaccurate.[12]

Statistics South Africa asks people to describe themselves in the census in terms of five racial population groups.[29] The 2011 census figures for these groups were African at 80.2%, White at 8.4%, Coloured at 8.8%, Indian/Asian at 2.5%, and Other/Unspecified at 0.5%.[30]
The white percentage of the population has sharply declined. The first census in South Africa in 1911 showed that whites made up 22% of the population. This declined to 16% in 1980,[31] 8.9% in 2011 and 7.65% in 2022.[32]: 21  Coloured South Africans replaced Whites as the largest minority group around 2010.

Main article: Languages of South Africa
South Africa has twelve official languages:[33] isiZulu[30] 24.4%, isiXhosa[30] 16.3%, Afrikaans[30] 10.6%, English[30] 8.7%, Sepedi[30] 10.0%, Setswana[30] 8.3%, Sesotho[30] 7.8%, Xitsonga[30] 4.7%, siSwati[30] 2.8%, Tshivenda[30] 2.5%, isiNdebele[30] 1.7% and South African Sign Language.[34]
In this regard, it is third only to Bolivia and India in number. While all the languages are formally equal, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2022 census, the three most spoken languages in the household are Zulu (24.4%), Xhosa (16.3%), and Afrikaans (10.6%).[3]
Between 1996 and 2022, the proportion of Afrikaans speakers declined from 14.5% to 10.6% and English held steady at 8.7%, whle isiZulu grew from 22.8% to 24.4%, and Xhosa declined from 17.9% to 16.3%[35]
The country also recognises several unofficial languages, including Sekholokoe, Fanagalo, Khwe, Lobedu, Nama, Northern Ndebele, Phuthi and San.[36] These unofficial languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.
Many of the ""unofficial languages"" of the San and Khoikhoi people contain regional dialects stretching northwards into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their hunter-gatherer societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming extinct.
Many white South Africans also speak other European languages, such as Portuguese (also spoken by black Angolans and Mozambicans), German, Serbian and Greek, while some Indians and other Asians in South Africa speak South Asian languages, such as Bhojpuri, Tamil, Hindi, Gujarati, Urdu and Telugu. Although many South Africans are of Huguenot (French) origin, South African French is spoken by fewer than 10,000 individuals country-wide. Congolese French is also spoken in South Africa by migrants.
The primary sign language of deaf South Africans is South African Sign Language. Other sign languages among indigenous peoples are also used.

According to the 2022 national census, Christians accounted for 85.3% of the population.[3] This includes[when?] Protestant (36.6%), Zionist Christian (11.1%), Pentecostal/Charismatic (8.2%), Roman Catholic (7.1%), Methodist (6.8%), Dutch Reformed (6.7%), Anglican (3.8%); members of other Christian churches accounted for another 36% of the population. Muslims accounted for 1.5% of the population, Other 2.3%, and 1.4% were Unspecified and None 15.1%.[citation needed]
Muslims are largely found among the Coloured and Indian ethnic groups. They have been joined by black or white South African converts as well as immigrants from other parts of Africa.[39] South African Muslims claim that their faith is the fastest-growing religion of conversion in the country, with the number of black Muslims growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004.[39][40]
The Hindu population has its roots in the British colonial period, but later waves of immigration from India have also contributed to it. Most Hindus are of South Asian origin, but there are many who come from mixed racial stock. Some are converts due to the efforts of ISKCON.
Other minority religions in South Africa are Sikhism, Jainism, Baháʼí Faith and Judaism.[41]

By ethnicity[edit]
86.0% of black residents are Christian, 3.0% have no religion, 0.3% are Muslim, 0.0% are Jewish, 0.0% are Hindu, 9.5% Traditional African and 1.2% have other or undetermined beliefs (2022 Census).
90.1% of white residents are Christian, 4.9% have no religion, 0.3% are Muslim, 0.7% are Jewish, and 0.1% are Hindu. 3.9% have other or undetermined beliefs (2022 Census).

Immigration[edit]

Main article: Immigration to South Africa
South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the World Refugee Survey 2008, published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007.[43] Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from Zimbabwe (48,400), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (24,800), and Somalia (12,900).[43] These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth.[43] Many refugees have now also started to work and live in rural areas in provinces such as Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal.
Statistics SA assumes in some of their calculations that there are fewer than 2 million immigrants in South Africa.[44] Other institutions, like the police and Médecins Sans Frontières place estimate the figure at 4 million.[45][46][47][48]

Others pointed out that the repeal of the Population Registration Act in 1991 removed any legal basis for specifying 'race'. The Identification Act of 1997 makes no mention of race. On the other hand, the Employment Equity Act speaks of 'designated groups' being 'black people, women and people with disabilities'. The Act defines 'black' as referring to 'Africans, coloureds and Indians'. Apartheid and the racial identification which underpinned it explicitly linked race with differential access to resources and power. If the post-apartheid order was committed to remedying this, race would have to be included in surveys and censuses, so that progress in eradicating the consequences of apartheid could be measured and monitored. This was the reasoning that led to a 'self-identifying' question about 'race' or 'population group' in both the 1996 and 2001 population censuses, and in Statistics SA's household survey programme.

Population density in South Africa (darker color = higher density)
According to the 2022 census, the population of South Africa is about 62 million people of diverse origins, cultures, languages, and religions. With a majority being Black Africans.[3] The South African National Census of 2022 was the most recent census held; the next will be in 2032.[4]
In 2011, Statistics South Africa counted 2.1 million foreigners in total.[5] Reports[specify] suggest that is an underestimation. The real figure may be as high as five million,[6] including some three million Zimbabweans.[7]


History[edit]
Historical population of South AfricaThe earliest creatures that can be identified as human ancestors in South Africa are  australopithecines. The first evidence of this was a child's skull found in the Taung quarry site. This was in the modern day North-West province. More fossils australopithecines were found in limestone caves Sterkfontein, Swartkrans, and Kromdaai. [8]Further information: History of South Africa

1904–85 national census numbers[edit]
Bantustan demographics were removed from South African census data during Apartheid and for this reason official figures on the national population of the country during that period will be inaccurate.[12]

Statistics South Africa asks people to describe themselves in the census in terms of five racial population groups.[29] The 2011 census figures for these groups were African at 80.2%, White at 8.4%, Coloured at 8.8%, Indian/Asian at 2.5%, and Other/Unspecified at 0.5%.[30]
The white percentage of the population has sharply declined. The first census in South Africa in 1911 showed that whites made up 22% of the population. This declined to 16% in 1980,[31] 8.9% in 2011 and 7.65% in 2022.[32]: 21  Coloured South Africans replaced Whites as the largest minority group around 2010.

Main article: Languages of South Africa
South Africa has twelve official languages:[33] isiZulu[30] 24.4%, isiXhosa[30] 16.3%, Afrikaans[30] 10.6%, English[30] 8.7%, Sepedi[30] 10.0%, Setswana[30] 8.3%, Sesotho[30] 7.8%, Xitsonga[30] 4.7%, siSwati[30] 2.8%, Tshivenda[30] 2.5%, isiNdebele[30] 1.7% and South African Sign Language.[34]
In this regard, it is third only to Bolivia and India in number. While all the languages are formally equal, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2022 census, the three most spoken languages in the household are Zulu (24.4%), Xhosa (16.3%), and Afrikaans (10.6%).[3]
Between 1996 and 2022, the proportion of Afrikaans speakers declined from 14.5% to 10.6% and English held steady at 8.7%, whle isiZulu grew from 22.8% to 24.4%, and Xhosa declined from 17.9% to 16.3%[35]
The country also recognises several unofficial languages, including Sekholokoe, Fanagalo, Khwe, Lobedu, Nama, Northern Ndebele, Phuthi and San.[36] These unofficial languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.
Many of the ""unofficial languages"" of the San and Khoikhoi people contain regional dialects stretching northwards into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their hunter-gatherer societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming extinct.
Many white South Africans also speak other European languages, such as Portuguese (also spoken by black Angolans and Mozambicans), German, Serbian and Greek, while some Indians and other Asians in South Africa speak South Asian languages, such as Bhojpuri, Tamil, Hindi, Gujarati, Urdu and Telugu. Although many South Africans are of Huguenot (French) origin, South African French is spoken by fewer than 10,000 individuals country-wide. Congolese French is also spoken in South Africa by migrants.
The primary sign language of deaf South Africans is South African Sign Language. Other sign languages among indigenous peoples are also used.

According to the 2022 national census, Christians accounted for 85.3% of the population.[3] This includes[when?] Protestant (36.6%), Zionist Christian (11.1%), Pentecostal/Charismatic (8.2%), Roman Catholic (7.1%), Methodist (6.8%), Dutch Reformed (6.7%), Anglican (3.8%); members of other Christian churches accounted for another 36% of the population. Muslims accounted for 1.5% of the population, Other 2.3%, and 1.4% were Unspecified and None 15.1%.[citation needed]
Muslims are largely found among the Coloured and Indian ethnic groups. They have been joined by black or white South African converts as well as immigrants from other parts of Africa.[39] South African Muslims claim that their faith is the fastest-growing religion of conversion in the country, with the number of black Muslims growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004.[39][40]
The Hindu population has its roots in the British colonial period, but later waves of immigration from India have also contributed to it. Most Hindus are of South Asian origin, but there are many who come from mixed racial stock. Some are converts due to the efforts of ISKCON.
Other minority religions in South Africa are Sikhism, Jainism, Baháʼí Faith and Judaism.[41]

By ethnicity[edit]
86.0% of black residents are Christian, 3.0% have no religion, 0.3% are Muslim, 0.0% are Jewish, 0.0% are Hindu, 9.5% Traditional African and 1.2% have other or undetermined beliefs (2022 Census).
90.1% of white residents are Christian, 4.9% have no religion, 0.3% are Muslim, 0.7% are Jewish, and 0.1% are Hindu. 3.9% have other or undetermined beliefs (2022 Census).

Immigration[edit]

Main article: Immigration to South Africa
South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the World Refugee Survey 2008, published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007.[43] Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from Zimbabwe (48,400), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (24,800), and Somalia (12,900).[43] These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth.[43] Many refugees have now also started to work and live in rural areas in provinces such as Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal.
Statistics SA assumes in some of their calculations that there are fewer than 2 million immigrants in South Africa.[44] Other institutions, like the police and Médecins Sans Frontières place estimate the figure at 4 million.[45][46][47][48]

Others pointed out that the repeal of the Population Registration Act in 1991 removed any legal basis for specifying 'race'. The Identification Act of 1997 makes no mention of race. On the other hand, the Employment Equity Act speaks of 'designated groups' being 'black people, women and people with disabilities'. The Act defines 'black' as referring to 'Africans, coloureds and Indians'. Apartheid and the racial identification which underpinned it explicitly linked race with differential access to resources and power. If the post-apartheid order was committed to remedying this, race would have to be included in surveys and censuses, so that progress in eradicating the consequences of apartheid could be measured and monitored. This was the reasoning that led to a 'self-identifying' question about 'race' or 'population group' in both the 1996 and 2001 population censuses, and in Statistics SA's household survey programme.

Population density in South Africa (darker color = higher density)
According to the 2022 census, the population of South Africa is about 62 million people of diverse origins, cultures, languages, and religions. With a majority being Black Africans.[3] The South African National Census of 2022 was the most recent census held; the next will be in 2032.[4]
In 2011, Statistics South Africa counted 2.1 million foreigners in total.[5] Reports[specify] suggest that is an underestimation. The real figure may be as high as five million,[6] including some three million Zimbabweans.[7]


History[edit]
Historical population of South AfricaThe earliest creatures that can be identified as human ancestors in South Africa are  australopithecines. The first evidence of this was a child's skull found in the Taung quarry site. This was in the modern day North-West province. More fossils australopithecines were found in limestone caves Sterkfontein, Swartkrans, and Kromdaai. [8]Further information: History of South Africa

1904–85 national census numbers[edit]
Bantustan demographics were removed from South African census data during Apartheid and for this reason official figures on the national population of the country during that period will be inaccurate.[12]

Statistics South Africa asks people to describe themselves in the census in terms of five racial population groups.[29] The 2011 census figures for these groups were African at 80.2%, White at 8.4%, Coloured at 8.8%, Indian/Asian at 2.5%, and Other/Unspecified at 0.5%.[30]
The white percentage of the population has sharply declined. The first census in South Africa in 1911 showed that whites made up 22% of the population. This declined to 16% in 1980,[31] 8.9% in 2011 and 7.65% in 2022.[32]: 21  Coloured South Africans replaced Whites as the largest minority group around 2010.

Languages[edit]
Main article: Languages of South Africa
South Africa has twelve official languages:[33] isiZulu[30] 24.4%, isiXhosa[30] 16.3%, Afrikaans[30] 10.6%, English[30] 8.7%, Sepedi[30] 10.0%, Setswana[30] 8.3%, Sesotho[30] 7.8%, Xitsonga[30] 4.7%, siSwati[30] 2.8%, Tshivenda[30] 2.5%, isiNdebele[30] 1.7% and South African Sign Language.[34]
In this regard, it is third only to Bolivia and India in number. While all the languages are formally equal, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2022 census, the three most spoken languages in the household are Zulu (24.4%), Xhosa (16.3%), and Afrikaans (10.6%).[3]
Between 1996 and 2022, the proportion of Afrikaans speakers declined from 14.5% to 10.6% and English held steady at 8.7%, whle isiZulu grew from 22.8% to 24.4%, and Xhosa declined from 17.9% to 16.3%[35]
The country also recognises several unofficial languages, including Sekholokoe, Fanagalo, Khwe, Lobedu, Nama, Northern Ndebele, Phuthi and San.[36] These unofficial languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. Nevertheless, their populations are not such that they require nationwide recognition.
Many of the ""unofficial languages"" of the San and Khoikhoi people contain regional dialects stretching northwards into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their hunter-gatherer societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and many of their languages are in danger of becoming extinct.
Many white South Africans also speak other European languages, such as Portuguese (also spoken by black Angolans and Mozambicans), German, Serbian and Greek, while some Indians and other Asians in South Africa speak South Asian languages, such as Bhojpuri, Tamil, Hindi, Gujarati, Urdu and Telugu. Although many South Africans are of Huguenot (French) origin, South African French is spoken by fewer than 10,000 individuals country-wide. Congolese French is also spoken in South Africa by migrants.
The primary sign language of deaf South Africans is South African Sign Language. Other sign languages among indigenous peoples are also used.

Judaism (0.1%)
Atheism (0.1%)
Agnosticism (0.1%)

According to the 2022 national census, Christians accounted for 85.3% of the population.[3] This includes[when?] Protestant (36.6%), Zionist Christian (11.1%), Pentecostal/Charismatic (8.2%), Roman Catholic (7.1%), Methodist (6.8%), Dutch Reformed (6.7%), Anglican (3.8%); members of other Christian churches accounted for another 36% of the population. Muslims accounted for 1.5% of the population, Other 2.3%, and 1.4% were Unspecified and None 15.1%.[citation needed]
Muslims are largely found among the Coloured and Indian ethnic groups. They have been joined by black or white South African converts as well as immigrants from other parts of Africa.[39] South African Muslims claim that their faith is the fastest-growing religion of conversion in the country, with the number of black Muslims growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004.[39][40]
The Hindu population has its roots in the British colonial period, but later waves of immigration from India have also contributed to it. Most Hindus are of South Asian origin, but there are many who come from mixed racial stock. Some are converts due to the efforts of ISKCON.
Other minority religions in South Africa are Sikhism, Jainism, Baháʼí Faith and Judaism.[41]

By ethnicity[edit]
86.0% of black residents are Christian, 3.0% have no religion, 0.3% are Muslim, 0.0% are Jewish, 0.0% are Hindu, 9.5% Traditional African and 1.2% have other or undetermined beliefs (2022 Census).
90.1% of white residents are Christian, 4.9% have no religion, 0.3% are Muslim, 0.7% are Jewish, and 0.1% are Hindu. 3.9% have other or undetermined beliefs (2022 Census).

Immigration[edit]

Main article: Immigration to South Africa
South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the World Refugee Survey 2008, published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007.[43] Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from Zimbabwe (48,400), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (24,800), and Somalia (12,900).[43] These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth.[43] Many refugees have now also started to work and live in rural areas in provinces such as Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal.
Statistics SA assumes in some of their calculations that there are fewer than 2 million immigrants in South Africa.[44] Other institutions, like the police and Médecins Sans Frontières place estimate the figure at 4 million.[45][46][47][48]

Others pointed out that the repeal of the Population Registration Act in 1991 removed any legal basis for specifying 'race'. The Identification Act of 1997 makes no mention of race. On the other hand, the Employment Equity Act speaks of 'designated groups' being 'black people, women and people with disabilities'. The Act defines 'black' as referring to 'Africans, coloureds and Indians'. Apartheid and the racial identification which underpinned it explicitly linked race with differential access to resources and power. If the post-apartheid order was committed to remedying this, race would have to be included in surveys and censuses, so that progress in eradicating the consequences of apartheid could be measured and monitored. This was the reasoning that led to a 'self-identifying' question about 'race' or 'population group' in both the 1996 and 2001 population censuses, and in Statistics SA's household survey programme.

Others pointed out that the repeal of the Population Registration Act in 1991 removed any legal basis for specifying 'race'. The Identification Act of 1997 makes no mention of race. On the other hand, the Employment Equity Act speaks of 'designated groups' being 'black people, women and people with disabilities'. The Act defines 'black' as referring to 'Africans, coloureds and Indians'. Apartheid and the racial identification which underpinned it explicitly linked race with differential access to resources and power. If the post-apartheid order was committed to remedying this, race would have to be included in surveys and censuses, so that progress in eradicating the consequences of apartheid could be measured and monitored. This was the reasoning that led to a 'self-identifying' question about 'race' or 'population group' in both the 1996 and 2001 population censuses, and in Statistics SA's household survey programme.

The Population of South Africa (1950 - 2024) chart plots the total population count as of July 1 of each year, from 1950 to 2024. The Yearly Population Growth Rate chart plots the annual percentage changes in population registered on July 1 of each year, from 1951 to 2024. This value can differ from the Yearly % Change shown in the historical table, which shows the last year equivalent percentage change assuming homogeneous change in the preceding five year period.   Definitions Year: as of July 1 of the year indicated. Population: Overall total population (both sexes and all ages) in the country as of July 1 of the year indicated, as estimated by the United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division. World Population Prospects: The 2024 Revision. For forecasted years, the U.N. medium-fertility variant is used.  Read More Definitions...  Yearly % Change: For 2024: percentage change in total population over the last year (from July 1, 2023 to June 30 2024). For all other years: latest year annual percentage change equivalent assuming homogeneous change in the preceding five year period, calculated through reverse compounding.  Yearly Change: For 2024: absolute change in total population (increase or decrease in number of people) over the last year (from July 1, 2023 to June 30 2024). For all other years: average annual numerical change over the preceding five year period. Migrants (net): The average annual number of immigrants minus the number of emigrants over the preceding five year period (running from July 1 to June 30 of the initial and final years), or subsequent five year period (for 2016 data). A negative number means that there are more emigrants than immigrants.  Median Age: age that divides the population into two numerically equal groups: half of the people are older than the median age indicated and half are younger. This parameter provides an indication of age distribution. Fertility Rate: (Total Fertility Rate, or TFR), it is expressed as children per woman. It is calculated as the average number of children an average woman will have during her reproductive period (15 to 49 years old) based on the current fertility rates of every age group in the country, and assuming she is not subject to mortality. Density (P/Km²): (Population Density) Population per square Kilometer (Km²). Urban Pop % : Urban population as a percentage of total population. Urban Population: Population living in areas classified as urban according to the criteria used by each country. Country's Share of World Pop: Total population in the country as a percentage of total World Population as of July 1 of the year indicated. World Population: Total World Population as of July 1 of the year indicated. Global Rank: Position held by South Africa in the list of all countries worldwide ranked by population (from the highest population to the lowest population) as of July 1 of the year indicated.

The Population of South Africa (1950 - 2024) chart plots the total population count as of July 1 of each year, from 1950 to 2024. The Yearly Population Growth Rate chart plots the annual percentage changes in population registered on July 1 of each year, from 1951 to 2024. This value can differ from the Yearly % Change shown in the historical table, which shows the last year equivalent percentage change assuming homogeneous change in the preceding five year period.   Definitions Year: as of July 1 of the year indicated. Population: Overall total population (both sexes and all ages) in the country as of July 1 of the year indicated, as estimated by the United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division. World Population Prospects: The 2024 Revision. For forecasted years, the U.N. medium-fertility variant is used.  Read More Definitions...  Yearly % Change: For 2024: percentage change in total population over the last year (from July 1, 2023 to June 30 2024). For all other years: latest year annual percentage change equivalent assuming homogeneous change in the preceding five year period, calculated through reverse compounding.  Yearly Change: For 2024: absolute change in total population (increase or decrease in number of people) over the last year (from July 1, 2023 to June 30 2024). For all other years: average annual numerical change over the preceding five year period. Migrants (net): The average annual number of immigrants minus the number of emigrants over the preceding five year period (running from July 1 to June 30 of the initial and final years), or subsequent five year period (for 2016 data). A negative number means that there are more emigrants than immigrants.  Median Age: age that divides the population into two numerically equal groups: half of the people are older than the median age indicated and half are younger. This parameter provides an indication of age distribution. Fertility Rate: (Total Fertility Rate, or TFR), it is expressed as children per woman. It is calculated as the average number of children an average woman will have during her reproductive period (15 to 49 years old) based on the current fertility rates of every age group in the country, and assuming she is not subject to mortality. Density (P/Km²): (Population Density) Population per square Kilometer (Km²). Urban Pop % : Urban population as a percentage of total population. Urban Population: Population living in areas classified as urban according to the criteria used by each country. Country's Share of World Pop: Total population in the country as a percentage of total World Population as of July 1 of the year indicated. World Population: Total World Population as of July 1 of the year indicated. Global Rank: Position held by South Africa in the list of all countries worldwide ranked by population (from the highest population to the lowest population) as of July 1 of the year

The Population of South Africa (1950 - 2024) chart plots the total population count as of July 1 of each year, from 1950 to 2024. The Yearly Population Growth Rate chart plots the annual percentage changes in population registered on July 1 of each year, from 1951 to 2024. This value can differ from the Yearly % Change shown in the historical table, which shows the last year equivalent percentage change assuming homogeneous change in the preceding five year period.   Definitions Year: as of July 1 of the year indicated. Population: Overall total population (both sexes and all ages) in the country as of July 1 of the year indicated, as estimated by the United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division. World Population Prospects: The 2024 Revision. For forecasted years, the U.N. medium-fertility variant is used.  Read More Definitions...  Yearly % Change: For 2024: percentage change in total population over the last year (from July 1, 2023 to June 30 2024). For all other years: latest year annual percentage change equivalent assuming homogeneous change in the preceding five year period, calculated through reverse compounding.  Yearly Change: For 2024: absolute change in total population (increase or decrease in number of people) over the last year (from July 1, 2023 to June 30 2024). For all other years: average annual numerical change over the preceding five year period. Migrants (net): The average annual number of immigrants minus the number of emigrants over the preceding five year period (running from July 1 to June 30 of the initial and final years), or subsequent five year period (for 2016 data). A negative number means that there are more emigrants than immigrants.  Median Age: age that divides the population into two numerically equal groups: half of the people are older than the median age indicated and half are younger. This parameter provides an indication of age distribution. Fertility Rate: (Total Fertility Rate, or TFR), it is expressed as children per woman. It is calculated as the average number of children an average woman will have during her reproductive period (15 to 49 years old) based on the current fertility rates of every age group in the country, and assuming she is not subject to mortality. Density (P/Km²): (Population Density) Population per square Kilometer (Km²). Urban Pop % : Urban population as a percentage of total population. Urban Population: Population living in areas classified as urban according to the criteria used by each country. Country's Share of World Pop: Total population in the country as a percentage of total World Population as of July 1 of the year indicated.

South Africa,population_stats,population,"Notes The South Africa Population (Live) counter shows a continuously updated estimate of the current population of South Africa delivered by Worldometer's RTS algorithm, which processes data collected from the United Nations Population Division. The Population of South Africa (1950 - 2024) chart plots the total population count as of July 1 of each year, from 1950 to 2024. The Yearly Population Growth Rate chart plots the annual percentage changes in population registered on July 1 of each year, from 1951 to 2024. This value can differ from the Yearly % Change shown in the historical table, which shows the last year equivalent percentage change assuming homogeneous change in the preceding five year period.   Definitions Year: as of July 1 of the year indicated. Population: Overall total population (both sexes and all ages) in the country as of July 1 of the year indicated, as estimated by the United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division. World Population Prospects: The 2024 Revision. For forecasted years, the U.N. medium-fertility variant is used.  Read More Definitions...  Yearly % Change: For 2024: percentage change in total population over the last year (from July 1, 2023 to June 30 2024). For all other years: latest year annual percentage change equivalent assuming homogeneous change in the preceding five year period, calculated through reverse compounding.  Yearly Change: For 2024: absolute change in total population (increase or decrease in number of people) over the last year (from July 1, 2023 to June 30 2024). For all other years: average annual numerical change over the preceding five year period. Migrants (net): The average annual number of immigrants minus the number of emigrants over the preceding five year period (running from July 1 to June 30 of the initial and final years), or subsequent five year period (for 2016 data). A negative number means that there are more emigrants than immigrants.  Median Age: age that divides the population into two numerically equal groups: half of the people are older than the median age indicated and half are younger. This parameter provides an indication of age distribution. Fertility Rate: (Total Fertility Rate, or TFR), it is expressed as children per woman. It is calculated as the average number of children an average woman will have during her reproductive period (15 to 49 years old) based on the current fertility rates of every age group in the country, and assuming she is not subject to mortality. Density (P/Km²): (Population Density) Population per square Kilometer (Km²). Urban Pop % : Urban population as a percentage of total population. Urban Population: Population living in areas classified as urban according to the criteria used by each country. Country's Share of World Pop: Total population in the country as a percentage of total World Population as of July 1 of the year indicated. World Population: Total World Population as of July 1 of the year indicated. Global Rank: Position held by South Africa in the list of all countries worldwide ranked by population (from the highest population to the lowest population) as of July 1 of the year indicated.","['1950', '2024', '1', '1950', '2024', '1', '1951', '2024', '1', '1', '2024', '2024', '1', '2023', '30', '2024', '2024', '1', '2023', '30', '2024', '1', '30', '2016', '15', '49', '1', '1', '1']",1950,Web Page: South Africa Population (2025) - Worldometer,https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/south-africa-population/,2.0,True,True,2025-03-04 01:59:31.808224,False,,False,,

                    South Africa
                    OverviewEditor’s PicksStatistics Around 59.3 million people lived within the borders of South Africa, which ranked the country among the six most populated on the African continent. The largest inhabited provinces were Gauteng (its capital city is Johannesburg) and KwaZulu-Natal (capital city Pietermaritzburg) with roughly 15.9 million and 11.7 million residents respectively. Cape Town, Durban, and Johannesburg were the cities with the largest communities, with close to 3.4 million, 3.1 million, and two million citizens. Moreover, the majority of the nation's population was Black Africans, while the smallest ethnic group were individuals with Indian or Asian backgrounds.


        A constrictive population pyramid  

The average life expectancy on the African continent was 64 years for women and 61 years for men in 2022. There were more women in the country than men. As of 2021, the fertility rate in South Africa was 2.37 children per woman, however, this was declining since 2019. The infant mortality rate was also dropping, another indicator for improved health care. The leading cause of death in the country was tuberculosis, followed by diabetes mellitus.

Growing number of households  

In 2021, the number of households increased, reaching approximately 17.9 million. Almost one in every three households had two to three members. The vast majority of South Africans lived in formal houses, succeeded by individuals living in informal dwellings. As of 2018, the most commonly spoken language inside and outside of the households was isiZulu. Between household members, isiXhosa followed. However, although English was not among the most spoken between members of the same family, it was the second most prevalent language spoken outside of places of residence.


Most income unequal country in the world  

Several African countries are known to have significant disparities regarding income distribution. In fact, South Africa had the highest income Gini index in the world at 63 percent. Over the years, this index improved slightly, being more unequal in urban areas than rural ones. It is worth noting that the monthly national food poverty line in the country was 663 South African rands.

                    South Africa
                    OverviewEditor’s PicksStatistics Around 59.3 million people lived within the borders of South Africa, which ranked the country among the six most populated on the African continent. The largest inhabited provinces were Gauteng (its capital city is Johannesburg) and KwaZulu-Natal (capital city Pietermaritzburg) with roughly 15.9 million and 11.7 million residents respectively. Cape Town, Durban, and Johannesburg were the cities with the largest communities, with close to 3.4 million, 3.1 million, and two million citizens. Moreover, the majority of the nation's population was Black Africans, while the smallest ethnic group were individuals with Indian or Asian backgrounds.


        A constrictive population pyramid  

The average life expectancy on the African continent was 64 years for women and 61 years for men in 2022. There were more women in the country than men. As of 2021, the fertility rate in South Africa was 2.37 children per woman, however, this was declining since 2019. The infant mortality rate was also dropping, another indicator for improved health care. The leading cause of death in the country was tuberculosis, followed by diabetes mellitus.

Growing number of households  

In 2021, the number of households increased, reaching approximately 17.9 million. Almost one in every three households had two to three members. The vast majority of South Africans lived in formal houses, succeeded by individuals living in informal dwellings. As of 2018, the most commonly spoken language inside and outside of the households was isiZulu. Between household members, isiXhosa followed. However, although English was not among the most spoken between members of the same family, it was the second most prevalent language spoken outside of places of residence.


Most income unequal country in the world  

Several African countries are known to have significant disparities regarding income distribution. In fact, South Africa had the highest income Gini index in the world at 63 percent. Over the years, this index improved slightly, being more unequal in urban areas than rural ones. It is worth noting that the monthly national food poverty line in the country was 663 South African rands.

South Africa Urban Population, 2021
Urban Population
The number of people who live in places that are closer together and have a higher population density as compared to the rural areas is referred to as the ""urban population.""
In addition to being more densely populated than rural areas, urban areas typically have a higher percentage of residents than rural areas. Therefore, a country's overall development and wealth can be determined by the proportion of its population that lives in urban areas as opposed to rural areas. Organizations such as the United Nations predict that as the global population grows, the proportion of people living in urban areas will steadily rise as more people move from rural to urban areas.
Urban Population of South Africa
The urban population of South Africa attained a value of 40 million people in 2021. It recorded a growth of 1.6% in 2021 compared to the previous year. Between 2018-2021, the urban population of South Africa increased by 6.5%. The urban population of South Africa was highest in 2021 with a value of 40 million people and lowest in 2018 with a value of 38 million, between 2018 and 2021.
Urban Population: Global Scenario
According to GlobalData, the countries with the highest urban population are China, India, the United States, Brazil, Indonesia, Japan, Nigeria, Russia, Mexico, and Pakistan and the countries with the lowest urban population include Eritrea, Montserrat, Niue, Saint Pierre, and Miquelon, Liechtenstein, Cook Islands, Tuvalu, Nauru, Republic of Palau, and Saint Kitts.
According to GlobalData, 4.4 billion people resided in urban areas in 2021. The world's urban population has grown rapidly from 755 million in 1960 to 4.4 billion in 2021 and will grow to 4.7 billion by 2026, adding about 0.3 billion people to urban areas. 90% of the projected growth of the world's urban population between 2021 and 2050 will occur in Asia and Africa.
Key Factors that Impact Urban Population Growth
The economy, natural increase in population, commercialization, female fertility rates, birth rates, death rates, healthcare facilities, industrialization, immigration and emigration rates, education, and other social and cultural variables all influence urban population growth.

Urban Population
The number of people who live in places that are closer together and have a higher population density as compared to the rural areas is referred to as the ""urban population.""
In addition to being more densely populated than rural areas, urban areas typically have a higher percentage of residents than rural areas. Therefore, a country's overall development and wealth can be determined by the proportion of its population that lives in urban areas as opposed to rural areas. Organizations such as the United Nations predict that as the global population grows, the proportion of people living in urban areas will steadily rise as more people move from rural to urban areas.
Urban Population of South Africa
The urban population of South Africa attained a value of 40 million people in 2021. It recorded a growth of 1.6% in 2021 compared to the previous year. Between 2018-2021, the urban population of South Africa increased by 6.5%.
